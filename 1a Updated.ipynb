    "This Evaluation section aims to gauge the performance of our trained k-NN model when exposed to new, unseen data. By comparing the predictions y_pred with the actual true labels y_test, we can ascertain how well our model is likely to perform in real-world scenarios where the true labels of input data are unknown ahead of time."
